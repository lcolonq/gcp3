                <p>
                    The Green Collective Projectile collects cool people from all parts of "cyber space". These people communicate with each other using assorted textual and audiovisual media across many protocols. This website obtains an objective and <it>canonical</it> measurement of the quote vibes unquote of the green area via classified sources and performs sophisticated analysis on those measurements to see how coherent they are. That is, we compute how good and nice things are for you, now, where you are, at this moment.

                    For more information on the complex space-age technology involved, you can consult the <a href="https://twitch.tv/LCOLONQ">video lecture series</a>

                    This is a real time data analysis of the Green Collective Projectile. It collects the data each instant and runs the numbers on the stream of random statistics generated by the projectiles. This analysis is run forever in lockstep with the current universal physics tick. In this way, it can be seen as a real-time indicator of something.
